<h1>What I've learned</h1>
<p>This is a major step in my coding journey. Here's what I learned so far:</p>
<ul>
<li>Headings, headers, footers, and the head and body of the page</li>
<li>Paragraphs</li>
<li>Links</li>
<li>Dividers</li>
<li>Using links and dividers together to navigate the page</li>
<li>Embedding images</li>
<li>Using images as links</li>
<li>Embedding videos</li>
</ul>
</div>

<div id= "somewhat of a demo">
<h1>Somewhat of a demo</h1>
<p>You already saw dividers, navigation, headings and lists, so I'm going to show you some other things. Just know that an embedded video may not work on Firefox, so you might want to use Chrome or Edge to view it instead.</p>

<h1>Final thoughts</h1>
<p>I'm glad to have learned all this stuff, and hopefully this is visible on GitHub, otherwise I screwed up. Up next I belive I start learning CSS and JavaScript, and with those I'll be able to make my future webpages a bit more polished looking, and add functioning buttons. Until then, goodbye. </p>
